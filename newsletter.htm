Dark Desiderata will feature the work of Jason Boren.  Mr. Boren is a graphic art student at K-State university in the last year of his major.  
He will contribute all artwork to this site for free web backgrounds, prints, tee shirts, ball caps, as well as custom tatoo artwork.  
Jason is married with one son and currently lives in Manhatten, KS.  Gary Wenke the web designer is creating a digital medium for Jason to get 
his artwork out and seen in the general public domain.  Mr. Wenke is married with one son and lives in Wichita, KS.  Gary is currently working 
on his first degree in computer technology.  This idea was discussed over a cup of coffee one day and is now starting to take shape.  
We are excited to offer original artwork for people to enjoy.  Mr. Boren has already used his artwork for the forces of good by donating a large print to an AIDS benefit at K-State.  
We here at Dark Desiderata are all about giving back to the community that allows us to express our ideas so freely and we thank you, our fans for this opportunity.  We are just 
getting started so please stay with us and give us your ideas so that we may grow and transform this site into something you can truely enjoy.  Keep the faith 
and treat each other with kindness.
<br />
<br />
Faithfully Yours,
<br />
<br />
The Dark Desiderata Crew
